                      Since we opened our doors in 2009, we’ve been obsessed by
                      creating a place that you would want to visit everyday.
                      It’s all about the casual atmosphere, super friendly
                      service, satisfying dishes & Single O coffee made with
                      love & care!
                      <br />
                      <br /> In 2015, we renovated the café, maintaining the
                      open floor plan and deciding to focus more on the Israeli
                      style menu aligning with our Jewish heritage! Nothing
                      beats a Jewish grandmothers cooking!
                      <br />
                      <br /> Earlier this year (2020), we spruced it up a little
                      more with some funky new wall tiles and the addition of
                      some great artworks by local Surry Hills artists.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      The ultimate Jew food must-trys are the ‘shakshuka’ – eggs
                      baked in a rich tomato & red pepper sauce, served w feta &
                      homemade pita, the ‘485 breakfast plate’ – falafel, boiled
                      egg, chilli hummus, amba, pickles, chopped salad, chilli,
                      tahini & pita, the ‘potato latkas’ and the homemade
                      chickpea falafel.
